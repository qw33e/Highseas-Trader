# Highseas-Trader
An html text-based mercantile sim

WARNING: THIS MIGHT BE THE WORST CODE YOU SEE IN YOUR LIFE
I wrote this cuz I saw the projared video about highseas trader and thought "yeah I wanna do that"
So I spent a month researching to make it as accurate as possible, ie correct distances by boat between every city, speed of various boats at the time, size of crew, amount of food for voyages, prices for everything in every city (as close as I could get with market economics and a bit of google) adjusted to the value of the carribean guilder, etc.

The text file lists all the locations and distances and prices and shit. It's basically cheating to read it but it is neat information
